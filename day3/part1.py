# Need to keep track of the location of each symbol and scan the surrounding 3 x 3 area for numbers
# Might also need to get the numbers from each line and store in a list
# The numbers that aren't detected by a symbol after the scan can be removed from the list
# Remaining numbers from the list can be summed -> do this for each row
# Symbols: @, #, $, %, &, *, -, +, =, / (10 in total)

# Based on the input data, assume no symbols will be present on any of the edges / borders

# Matrix coordinates to scan would be as follows:
# (r-1, c-1), (r-1, c), (r-1, c+1) ...
# (r, c-1),   (r, c),   (r, c+1)   ...
# (r+1, c-1), (r+1, c), (r+1, c+1) ...
# ...

# Use pandas to organise input data into a matrix, use size function to determine rows and cols in input data
# For a given coordinate (r, c), scan through using these two nested for loops:
# for r in range(1, rows-1):
    # for c in range(1, cols-1):
        # if matrix[r][c] in symbols:
            # Scan 3 x 3 area to see if there are any numbers (MAKE SURE TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING)
